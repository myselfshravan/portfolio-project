# Web dev Resource - Shravan

Hello, I am listing all the resources and my personal suggestions to start with Full Stack Web Development. This page is a work in progress, so I will keep adding stuff here.

I have learned quite a lot while exploring everything by myself and I want to share that with everyone who is starting out.

Good luck with your web dev journey!

Let's begin...

## Most Important thing

I would **highly** recommend every one to make a practice of reading the official documentation and learn how to code from that. It will be difficult in the beginning, but once u get familiar with understanding the documentation, u can learn and development language within a short amount of time.

No online course or module ever explicitly mentions that the course-takers should actually take time to read the documentation of the technology they are using.

When you avoid reading the documentation, you‚Äôre missing out on understanding the deeper mechanical processes of your code, which may lead to you writing less efficient code. You‚Äôd end up spending precious hours on websites like Stack Overflow or GitHub Wiki, trying to find why that line of code on line 7 doesn‚Äôt work, or suddenly why did the compiler throw an error.

Here is the link for official doc of all language

### Tips

1. My basic rule is
    ‚Äú**Copy Like an Artist**‚Äù: Borrow elements that you like from other people's designs in the wild and combine them in a way that fits your use case. Not directly copy them, mind you, but use other people's designs to inform your own. And if you have noticed, all my websites‚Äô UI is good-looking because of that.
2. In my opinion, project-based learning is the most effective and best way of learning. So I would highly recommend everyone to start directly making projects. For example, try cloning your favorite website. You will have fun when you see the outcome.
3. I usually stick to 2‚Äì3 colors total for components and styling. Simple looks modern and sleek. [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/). This tool is helpful sometimes.
4. If what you‚Äôre working on is text-heavy, make sure your fonts and your sizes are good. A Type-Scale is a good starting point. The CSS properties ‚Äúline-height‚Äù and ‚Äúletter-spacing‚Äù are crucial for making things feel comfortable. Making sure your design is responsive is also important.

**Keep learning and keep improving your skills. Good luck‚úåÔ∏è.**
